Hey Lindy,
Hope this message finds you well. Thank you for connecting with me.

I am a graduate student at NEU majoring in Information systems, expecting to graduate in May 2023. I am currently looking for full-time positions related to software engineering (data analyst). I recently came across the software engineering 2 position at your organization.
I believe I am a good fit for this position owing to my experience working as SDE intern at Amazon. I gained valuable experience and skills using
Using Java, Python, etc.

It is my humble request to you to spare 15 minute of valuable time....
